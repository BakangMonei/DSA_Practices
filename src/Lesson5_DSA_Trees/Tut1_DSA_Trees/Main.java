/* Trees
    - The Tree data structure is similar to Linked Lists in that each node contains data and can be linked to other nodes.
    - We have previously covered data structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues.
    - These are all linear structures, which means that each element follows directly after another in a sequence.
    - Trees however, are different. In a Tree, a single element can have multiple 'next' elements, allowing the data structure to branch out in various directions.

/* Types of Trees
    Trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, used to represent hierarchical relationships. This tutorial covers several key types of trees.
        - Binary Trees: Each node has up to two children, the left child node and the right child node. This structure is the foundation for more complex tree types like Binay Search Trees and AVL Trees.
        - Binary Search Trees (BSTs): A type of Binary Tree where for each node, the left child node has a lower value, and the right child node has a higher value.
        - AVL Trees: A type of Binary Search Tree that self-balances so that for every node, the difference in height between the left and right subtrees is at most one. This balance is maintained through rotations when nodes are inserted or deleted.
